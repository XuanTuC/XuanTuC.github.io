<p>I wanted to talk today about one of the most common mistakes that we make when we’re really excited about someone. We’re attracted, and we want to bring them closer to us. We want to turn it into something lasting. And maybe we feel like that person is either a little bit out of reach, or we feel like we’re not entirely sure of how they feel about us. And we find ourselves investing more and more in them to try to secure the relationship.<br>In the process, what happens is the things that are important in our life right now, whether it’s our friends, our family, our hobbies, the things that give us a sense of value and identity in our lives, those things start to fade into the background as we make this past person the focus of all of our attention.<br>Why do we do this? Well, when we really want to find love, and we suddenly meet someone who seems to epitomize everything we’ve been looking for, we’ve decided, based on this person’s qualities. Characteristics, what they look like, how they act, that this is the love we’ve been looking for. All of a sudden, it feels like there is nothing more important the world then securing this thing. And we do the one thing in this moment that is the opposite of what we should be doing. We should be grounding ourselves in the things that are important in our own life. And connecting to these things. That give us a sense of worth outside of a person. And yet, we lose connection with all of those things, and we get drawn into the gravitational pull.<br>Of, how do I please this person? How do I make this person mine? How do I make them want me? That instinct to try harder when we want to get someone. Is actually an instinct that works against us. Because someone doesn’t become more attracted to us. Or want us more, simply because we’re trying harder. When they feel is trying harder. And for some people, it makes them kind of pull away a bit, or it makes them feel like a. They can pick us up and put us down whenever they want. It makes them feel like they’re in control the whole time. It makes us even more anxious. And then we drift even further from these other things that matter in our life in an attempt to double down on the energy that we’re putting into this person.<br>There’s a story that Mark Manson talks about in his book the subtle art of not giving a. And he tells the story of a guy called David mustane who got kicked out of the band Metallica and went on to start the band mega death, which was a hugely successful band. David Mustang is seen as one of the most influential people in his genre. And that band, megadeth, went on to sell 25 million albums and tour the world several times. But he couldn’t get it out of his mind that he would never be successful, truly successful, unless he was able to outdo what his old being band, Metallica was doing. But Metallica were huge. They sold 125 million albums. And he really struggled with the chasm between where they were and where he perceived himself to be in his success.<br>Mark Manson then compares this story to the story of Pete best, a guy who was kicked out of the Beatles, but went on to marry and have kids. Kids, and have a very happy life. A happy life that he described as only being possible because he got kicked out of the Beatles. And he wasn’t resentful for that. He was happy about it. He said, being kicked out of the Beatles brought me to the life that I now love.<br>Now, what Mark Manson points out is that the difference in why Pete best was able to be happy in a way that David Mustang wasn’t, is because Pete best valued different things. And if we want to be happy, we have to learn to value the right things.<br>Now, let’s take this back to the dating scenario, when we value, more than anything else, the idea of finding a person to share our lives with. And then we meet a person who represents that dream in the flesh, all of a sudden, will do anything to make that happen, even if it means losing or ignoring all of these other important parts of our life. And, of course, when we ignore certain things, we lose connection to them, and they don’t feel as significant anymore. And, of course, when we divest in them, they start to shrink, because they’re not getting love and attention from us anymore.<br>What we have to do is, which is very counterintuitive, when we find something we really want, is double down on the meaning that we get from these other areas of our life. Whether it’s your hobbies, your passions, your friends, your family, the ways you love spending your time, the books you love reading, the things you love to do, the things you love to learn about your purpose. Those things are the things that, if you value them, will not only bring you a sense of perspective in your life, where you go, oh, my life is so much bigger than this one area. Of course, I would love for this person to reciprocate, and I’d love for it to go somewhere. But if it doesn’t, I have a big, rich life. These things are incredibly important to me, and I have those to fall back on. If we do that, it’s like having legs under the table. I want you to imagine that here’s your confidence. It’s like a tabletop. And that tabletop is supported by these pillars, or legs under the table. And each one of those legs is a different part of your life. That gives you strength, that gives you meaning, that gives you purpose, that gives you love.<br>Now, those are all the things that when we meet someone, we want to come with those legs already strong under the table. We never want to meet someone and either, a, not have them or b, suddenly decide that the legs under the table we do have unimportant anymore. Because we found this one really important leg. So at the very time that we feel like we found the dream person, that’s when we have to double down on the areas of our life that support the table. Because when that happens, we’re able to go into that situation as someone’s equal, knowing that if it doesn’t work out, I’m good.<br>I got legs under the table, right? You can break. I’ve got more legs under the table. I don’t need to beg. I don’t need to try harder than is reasonable. I don’t need to keep chasing you. I’m just gonna bring you my best, show you this wonderful life I’ve created. And if that’s not enough for you, and if you don’t give me enough, I don’t need this.<br>I like to think of confidence the same way we think of <strong>fu</strong> money. When we think of someone who has <strong>fu</strong> money. What we really describe there is someone who has so much money. That they can say no to anything that isn’t right for them. Well, I like to think of <strong>fu</strong> confidence. <strong>Fu</strong> confidence is when you have so many sturdy legs. Supporting the table of your confidence. That if someone comes along that isn’t right for you. Either because they treat you badly. Or because they don’t invest in you. Or they show that they’re not sure sure of you. Or because you’re not sure of them.<br>You are able to say, no, thank you. I’m good. Because you have so many other things in your life that give you meaning and richness and love and importance. You don’t know need that person. No matter how sexy they may be, however hot they may be, or successful or high status. That nothing could be so sexy that it becomes the most important thing in your life, to the detriment of everything else. You could be sexy and still be wrong for me. And real confidence isn’t the ability to say no to things you don’t want. Real confidence is the ability to say no to things you do want when they’re not right for you.</p>
